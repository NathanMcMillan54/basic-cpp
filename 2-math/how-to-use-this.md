Compile using ``g++`` command.

```commandline
make clean
make all
```

``addition_subtraction.cpp``:

When doing math in C++ you would do something like this
```c++
int i = 5;
i = i + 10;
```

You say i = i + 10 so i now equals 15.

##

``multiplication_division.cpp``:

This is the same with addition and subtraction (i = answer). Instead of using x and รท for multiplication and division we
use * an /.

Example:
```c++
int i = 5;
int x = 2;

i = i * x;

i = i / x;
```

##

``fibonacci-sequence.cpp``:
There is nothing to say about this except you should try to figure out how it works. A big part of programming is 
understanding how something works.
